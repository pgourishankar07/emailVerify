I have designed a Login and Logout page using Passport. Before logging in, users must first register, during which their email and hashed password are securely stored in MongoDB. Additionally, I've implemented a "Forgot Password" feature. If a user forgets their password, they can request a password reset via email. The reset functionality is powered by nodemailer, which sends a link to the user allowing them to set a new password.
